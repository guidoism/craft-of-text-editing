# The Craft of Text Editing

(Attempts) at an implementation from the book: [The Craft of Text Editing - or - Emacs for the Modern World](https://www.finseth.com/craft/) by Craig A. Finseth.

## Motivation

For me to learn how a large editor like emacs works by writing something similar myself. Secondary motivations include: Producing readable source that other's can study and learn from, producing an editor that I might actual want to use.

## Assumptions
